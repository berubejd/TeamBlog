summary: Although there is not much to see here, this has been a wonderful journey so far!

About a week ago, I wanted to create something.  While I have a *huge* backlog of ideas, there were a couple I wanted to play around with:

* Passwordless login
* Markdown based flat-file HTML generation

Okay, maybe that doesn't sound too exciting. :)  Regardless, it seemed the best solution was a "simple" blog system.  (Although, that doesn't fit into any of the backlog of items.. haha)  I pulled out my trusty laptop and got to work...

That may not be entirely accurate because I can't stand working from a laptop, unfortunately.  I am far too use to having large screens to work from.  Regardless, six days later, I have what you see in front of you.  Give it a spin and let me know if you find it interesting.

Thanks!
