                    <p>There are a few pieces of software that this site implements.</p><p>The site uses a custom
                        passwordless login system which doesn't depend on <a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/"
                            target="_blank">flask-login <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> at all.  Access is provided 
                            via encrypted tokens provided to administrators by email and email delivery is being handled by Sendgrid via their 
                            API.</p><p>The blog pages themselves are generated from markdown stored on the filesystem by <a
                            href="https://flask-flatpages.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">flask-flatpages <i
                                class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and created via the Admin Portal located at
                        '/admin'. The portal uses a JavaScript library called SimpleMDE (provided by <a
                            href="https://flask-simplemde.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">flask-simplemde <i
                                class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>) to provide an incredible editor that allows 
                                the final page to be previewed before being published.</p><p>Finally, the image management page leverages
                        a small amount of custom JavaScript written using jQuery and <a
